The results are placed inside their corresponding folder.
Each folder name follows the following format : x_AuthorName_PaperSubject
where 
- x is the order of apparition in the report: For instance, 1_Weisbuch_WindowAutomata is the first set of models to appear in the report.
- AuthorName is the name of the author of the reference paper. The reference paper is inside the folder in case of need.
- PaperSubject is the topic of the reference paper.

Within each folder, results are listed : those with "Ext" (for Extended) uses the extended syntax and were obtained using RISE.
The results obtained with the original CD++ are in Original and have the same name without "Ext".

To visualize the DRW, use the corresponding PAL files are provided within each folder.

The name of the PAL file will either say Kelvin or Celsius in that case.
