Supercooling Experiments
-------------------------
Multiple experiments were run in order to test the correctness of our model and also exhibit the relationship between the initial supercooling temperatures and the dendritic growth velocity. A set of simulations were performed using initial supercooling temperatures ranging from -60 to -32°C. In addition to the temperatures variation, we performed simulations using different dimensions: 7,15,25,49 and 99. Different configurations (location and size) of the nucleus were tested: Nucleus of size 1 and 3, plus center and corner locations. The scripts used to generate these experiments are described in details in the report.

About the folders in this directory:

ExperimentGenerator
*********************
Run generateAllExperiments.SH if you want to generate all the MA,VAL and SH file to run all the experiment.

GeneratedMA_VAL_Files
**********************
Contains ready-to-go MA and VAL files that can be used for quick tests.
Run one of the exp_runner.sh to generate results.

LogsSamples
************
This folder contains some logs(for 7x7x7).
All logs could not be included since they are too large.
They are available on Google Drive(larger dimensions such as 15x15x15 and larger).
