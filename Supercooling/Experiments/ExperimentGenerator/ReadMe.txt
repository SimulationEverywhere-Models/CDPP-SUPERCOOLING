Using Cygwin or another terminal, run generateAllExperiments.sh to generate all the MA and VAL files.
A script named exp_runner.sh will be generated as well, and will enbale you to run all the simulations in a batch fashion.

Note that the last simulations to run will be large and will require a lot of ressources.
You may also modify exp_runner.sh and only run the simulations you are interested in only.

This version uses CD++ version 3.6. and gives a path to the corresponding executable for simu and drawlog.
If you have a different version, please update the path to drawlog.exe and simuOrig.exe in the sh file.
